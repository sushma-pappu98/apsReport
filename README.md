# PSTL Gamma Correction sample

This example demonstrates PSTL with gamma correction - a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode the luminance of each image pixel. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction for more information.

The example creates a fractal image in memory and performs gamma correction on it. The output of the example application is a BMP image with corrected luminance.

The computations are performed using DPC++ backend of Parallel STL.

## How to build

```bash
# To this point you should have
# - TBB and Parallel STL installed and
# - environment variables set up to use them

# Configure, build and run the example
    mkdir build &&  
    cd build &&  
    cmake ../. &&  
    make VERBOSE=1  
```
